What kind of technology you are going to use?

1. What we are going to make is a vehicle which acts as a trash disposing machine. 

2. We will make it because it will keep streets tidy and neat while mitigating human labor.
   We will make it so that it can improve/solve environmental problems.

3. We will control the vehicle which exists in an emulator through an external controller to fulfil its purpose. 
   We will add virtual functions to the vehicle. For example a virtual bag which when being filled up drives around in different directions, takes object collision into respect,      and will return the vehicle to a designated area in the emulator when bag is full. The bag will take distance into account when deciding it is filled up. You can also take        manual  control of the vehicle.

   We are going to use an external java controller (into an android app?)
