## Description 

TDM is a cleaning Smartcar controlled by an app. When using our product, the user can choose between two modes: Clean Manually or clean a certain area autonomously. In the manual cleaning mode, the user can drive around and area with the option to turn on/off the vacuum cleaner function. In the autonomous cleaning mode, the user can chose to clean any size of are from two set of pre-programmed patterns. TDM is a two-tier system that inlcudes an Android app and SmartCar, where request are sent to the Smartcar from the app through a MQTT broker. To see the software architecture of TDM, please refer to the [Class Diagram](https://github.com/DIT112-V21/group-16/wiki/Class-Diagram) Wiki page.

### What we are going to make.
- What we are going to make is a vehicle which acts as a trash disposing machine. 

### Why we will make it. 
- We will make it because it will keep streets tidy and neat while mitigating human labor.
- We will make it so that it can improve/solve environmental problems.

### How we are going to make it. 
- The vechicle will be able to clean an area based on a path. 
- The vechicle will fill up a virtual bag, take object collision into respect and return to a designated area in the emulator when bag is full.
- The bag will take distance into account when deciding it is filled up. 
- The user will be able to control the vehicle which exists in an emulator through an external controller to fulfil its purpose. 
- It will also be possible to take manual control of the vehicle.
