## Description 
### What we are going to make.
- We are going to make an autonomous driven vehichle witht the purpose of cleaning in dorr areas. The vehicle will have a manual controlled option that implements obstacle avoidance and a joystick to manouver with. The automated controll function will feature 2 "Cleaning Pattern" they are a zig zag type pattern and a square pattern allowing the user to adapt the automation to what is best suited for their envoirnement. Furthermore the user can input the size field of the area they wish to clean as well as the velocity. 
- The vehicle will be controlled through an android app connected through an mqtt broker. 

### Why we will make it. 
- We will make it because it will keep streets tidy and neat while mitigating human labor.
- We will make it so that it can improve/solve environmental problems.

### How we are going to make it. 
- The vechicle will be able to clean an area based on a path. 
- The vechicle will fill up a virtual bag, take object collision into respect and return to a designated area in the emulator when bag is full.
- The bag will take distance into account when deciding it is filled up. 
- The user will be able to control the vehicle which exists in an emulator through an external controller to fulfil its purpose. 
- It will also be possible to take manual control of the vehicle.
